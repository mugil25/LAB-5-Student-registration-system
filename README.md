### AIM:
To develop a project Student Registration System using Rational Rose Software and to
implement the software in Java.
### PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND PROJECT PLANNING:
A Student Registration system (SRS) is a software application for educational
establishments to manage student data. Student information systems provide capabilities for
entering student test and other assessment scores, building student schedules, tracking student
attendance, and managing many other student-related data needs in a school, college or
university.
### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
a. Effective for Administration Purpose
b. Cost effective
c. Better Service
